After having ordered the board from [OSHPark](http://www.oshpark.com) I realised
a week later that I hadn't orderd the WiFi modules (ESP-12). Not to worry, I
 jump on eBay and come across the ESP-12E modules. With more pins and a pinout
 diagram that is the same I purchase them.

 I learn't three lessons.

 **Lesson One: Whims**

 When you've spent the entire design process with one model, don't change models
  on a whim an expect it to be the same just because the pinout was. This caused
 a couple of problems. The first of which caused more issues when I soldered
 everything together. That lead me to lesson two.

 **Lesson Two: Check Twice**

 If you've just spent some time building your new project and it doesn't work
 when you turn it on it's probably because you swapped something out last minute
. Instead of checking the datasheet of the new module (ESP-12E) to see what
changed from the ESP-12 I thought I had a power supply issue. To solve this I
wired up a 12 volt SLA battery ensuring all the red wire connected to the other
red wire and the black to black. When I plugged it in I learn't lesson 3.

**Lesson Three: Magic Smoke**

The magic smoke escaped. What happened was the red and black wires on the JST
connector were different on the battery than the wire I had bought off eBay. So
even though I had connected the wires correctly it was still incorrect. I'll be
checking with a multimeter from now on. At this point I chose to ignore it in
the hope that everything still worked. I reconnected the wires around the right
way and waited for some output on the serial monitor, but I got nothing. I pick
it up by the power regulator and got burnt. By now I was frustrated so I left it
for another day.

Today I tried again. and after a lot of troubleshooting realised I had designed
the PCB incorrectly for the DHT22 sensor and because I didn't read the datasheet
 for the new module the PCB was incorrect for a second reason.

After reading the data sheet I discovered that GPIO15 needs to be tied LOW, see
this snippet from the
[datasheet](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/images/7/7d/ESP-12E_brief_spec.pdf)

The second design flaw was the connection of the DHT22 pin to the ESP-12E module
 I had connected the 10k Ohm resistor from groud to VCC but didn'd connect the
 DHT22 data pin to any pin of the module.

 I fixed these by placing a blog of solder between ground and GPIO15 and
 soldering a piece if insulated copper wire from the data pin to GPIO4 of the
 ESP-12E.

 It's now been working for the last hour connected to my home wireless and
 sending values using MQTT to my adafruit.io

 **Usability**

 Next stage is to make this a usable device for anyone.
