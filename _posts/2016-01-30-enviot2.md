Since first prototyping the environmental IoT device i've changed my mind on a
few things. First is that having a temperature sensor attached to a GPS is
kind of bulky especially if you want to have it connected over WiFi. instead
I'm splitting it out into two separate projects. First is the temperature and
humidity sensor, second is the environmental box. The temp sensor will be a very
low cost and wireless device that sends its data to an MQTT broker. The
environmental box will not be wifi connected and it's purpose will be to mostly
look cool.

This post details the design and process of the WiFi temperature and humidity
sensor.

Prototyping will be completed on a breadboard and designed using
[Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/). The final PCB design will be completed in
[EagleCad](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/).

I had originally started out with the ESP8266 ESP-01 but was unable to have it
connect to my router. While I'm sure with a bit of troubleshooting I would have
succeeded in establishing connectivity I was not convinced it would be the
easiest module to attach to a PCB. Since this project ultimately aims to have
a PCB version the decision was easy. Plus I get more pins and it looks cooler.

**Breadboarding**
I was disappointed to see that upon plugging the module into the breadboard
the breakout board pins were at each extreme thus not allowing me to plug
any pins in like is typically done. As a quick fix I forced some longer headers
into the board and then the breakout board into the headers.

The code is a merge of a couple of Adafruit/Sparkfun/DFrobot examples. They
really make it easy.

io.adafruit.com using MQTT. The dashboad is public and can be viewed at
