I've been interested in electronics and small useful devices for most of my life. When I was a kid I thought the prospect of owning a device that did everything was silly so I preferred buying something that had one function. The reasoning was that no one would make a device that did one thing badly. Obviously that was flawed. Today I'm still very interested in those small one use devices and modularity. To better understand how IoT devices are made and how they connect to the world I've taken a pretty common concept and will be building it from modular electronics to create my very first IoT device.

As the Queensland summer rolls in "How's the weather?" small talk picks up and responses generally consist of something to the effect of "Bloody hot mate". I want to answer the question literally. "It's currently 32 degrees celsius and 90% humidity". Determined by looking at my phone that is connected to the local wireless and pulling environmental statistics from my Internet of Things device.

To build this device I want to know the following:

* GPS accurate time
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Barometric pressure

All in a self contained enclosure accessible over a wireless network.

Regarding it's functionality I wanted it to be built to the following priorities:

1. Precision
2. Reliability
3. Efficiency
4. Smallest size

I used a local electronics distributor called [Little Bird Electronics](http://littlebirdelectronics.com) and purchased the following parts:

* Adafruit CC3000 WiFi Breakout
* SMA to uFL/u.FL/IPX/IPEX RF Adapter Cable
* SparkFun Barometric Pressure Sensor Breakout - BMP180
* Digital Temperature & humidity sensor (With Stainless Steel Probe)
* Antenna GPS 3V Magnetic Mount SMA
* Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout - 66 channel w/10 Hz updates [Version 3]

Prototyping will be completed on a breadboard and designed using [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/).

I will need to test and verify each of the sensors is working independently.

Temperature and Humidity
===
Since it's quite humid right now I'll begin with the temperature and humidity sensor show below.

![Temperature and Humidity Sensor]({{cadamei.net}}/media/images/201511_enviot/2015-11-28 12.36.35_1024.jpg)

Using the example code and library supplied by dfrobot [here](http://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/Digital_Temperature_and_Humidity_sensor_(With_Stainless_Steel_Probe)_(SKU:SEN0148))

{% highlight c++ %}
//Arduino Sample Code for SHT1x Humidity and Temperature Sensor
//www.DFRobot.com
//Version 1.0

#include <SHT1x.h>

// Specify data and clock connections and instantiate SHT1x object
#define dataPin  10
#define clockPin 11
SHT1x sht1x(dataPin, clockPin);

void setup()
{
   Serial.begin(38400); // Open serial connection to report values to host
   Serial.println("Starting up");
}

void loop()
{
  float temp_c;
  float temp_f;
  float humidity;

  // Read values from the sensor
  temp_c = sht1x.readTemperatureC();
  temp_f = sht1x.readTemperatureF();
  humidity = sht1x.readHumidity();

  // Print the values to the serial port
  Serial.print("Temperature: ");
  Serial.print(temp_c, DEC);
  Serial.print("C / ");
  Serial.print(temp_f, DEC);
  Serial.print("F. Humidity: ");
  Serial.print(humidity);
  Serial.println("%");

  delay(2000);
}

{% endhighlight %}

I placed the inputs as shown here:

![SHT Wiring]({{ site.url }}/media/images/201511_enviot/Temperature_and_humidity_sensor_(FIT0320).png)

I obtained the following output:

>Temperature: 29.6800003051C / 85.4959945678F. Humidity: 70.99%    
Temperature: 29.6599960327C / 85.5139923095F. Humidity: 70.96%    
Temperature: 29.6800003051C / 85.5139923095F. Humidity: 70.96%    
Temperature: 29.6800003051C / 85.4959945678F. Humidity: 70.96%    
Temperature: 29.6800003051C / 85.4959945678F. Humidity: 70.89%    
Temperature: 29.6699981689C / 85.4959945678F. Humidity: 70.86%    
Temperature: 29.6699981689C / 85.4959945678F. Humidity: 70.83%    
Temperature: 29.6599960327C / 85.4959945678F. Humidity: 70.83%    
Temperature: 29.6599960327C / 85.4959945678F. Humidity: 70.89%    
Temperature: 29.6699981689C / 85.4779968261F. Humidity: 71.08%

So as we can see here it's not *that* humid.

Barometric Pressure Sensor
===
Next is the barometric pressure sensor. There are a few things that need to be known about this barometric pressure sensor. They are probably the same things you need to know about all barometric pressure sensors but I am not certain.

**Thing number one.**

The Bosch BMP180 has two sensors. A *raw pressure* sensor and a temperature sensor. They need to be used together to calculate the *absolute pressure* since the pressure will change with temperature. When the temperature goes up the *raw pressure* goes down and vice versa. In order to compensate for this this change the temperature sensor is an input to the *absolute pressure* calculation.

**Thing number two.**

Pressure changes with the altitude, so we need to supply the altitude of the sensor if we are to calculate the *relative pressure*. The BMP180 library contains functions to calculate these values so I won't go into the formulas but I will supply this [page](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/bmp180-barometric-pressure-sensor-hookup-) that will repeat all of this but in more detail. Essentially if environmental data taken from multiple sensors located at different altitudes then we need to compensate for the pressure change in the altitude so we have a common pressure that we can compare, this is the *relative pressure*, or the calculated pressure for sea level. Not to be confused with the average sea-level pressure widely agreed upon as being 1013.25hPa.

**Thing number three.**

If we don't know our altitude then we can calculate it if we provide the average pressure at sea level in hPa, which is 1013.25hPa to the *altitude* function that comes with the BMP180 library. It can then take the *absolute pressure* and the average sea level pressure and calculate our altitude. Since I will be including a GPS into this device I'll be using the altitude provided by that to feed the *relative pressure* function since I'm interested in the environmental data and not how high we are.

Using the following code we get a program that reads the data from the sensor and outputs the *provided altitude*, *absolute pressure*, *computed altitude* and *relative (sea-level) pressure*.

Please note that the original code can be found [here](https://github.com/sparkfun/BMP180_Breakout)

I have modified it to display refreshed values so you can only monitor the serial using Putty another similar program. The Arduino serial monitor does not support escape characters.

{% highlight c++ %}
// Your sketch must #include this library, and the Wire library.
// (Wire is a standard library included with Arduino.):

#include <SFE_BMP180.h>
#include <Wire.h>

// You will need to create an SFE_BMP180 object, here called "pressure":

void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("REBOOT");

  // Initialize the sensor (it is important to get calibration values stored on the device).

  if (pressure.begin())
    Serial.println("BMP180 init success");
  else
  {
    // Oops, something went wrong, this is usually a connection problem,
    // see the comments at the top of this sketch for the proper connections.

    Serial.println("BMP180 init fail\n\n");
    while(1); // Pause forever.
  }
}

void loop()
{
  char status;
  double T,P,p0,a,slp;

  // Loop here getting pressure readings every 10 seconds.

  // If you want sea-level-compensated pressure, as used in weather reports,
  // you will need to know the altitude at which your measurements are taken.
  // We're using a constant called ALTITUDE in this sketch:

  Serial.write(27);       // ESC command
  Serial.print("[2J");    // clear screen command
  Serial.write(27);
  Serial.print("[H");     // cursor to home

  Serial.println();
  Serial.print("provided altitude: ");
  Serial.print(ALTITUDE,2);
  Serial.println(" meters");

  // If you want to measure altitude, and not pressure, you will instead need
  // to provide a known baseline pressure. This is shown at the end of the sketch.

  // You must first get a temperature measurement to perform a pressure reading.

  // Start a temperature measurement:
  // If request is successful, the number of ms to wait is returned.
  // If request is unsuccessful, 0 is returned.

  status = pressure.startTemperature();
  if (status != 0)
  {
    // Wait for the measurement to complete:
    delay(status);

    // Retrieve the completed temperature measurement:
    // Note that the measurement is stored in the variable T.
    // Function returns 1 if successful, 0 if failure.

    status = pressure.getTemperature(T);
    if (status != 0)
    {
      // Print out the measurement:
      Serial.print("temperature: ");
      Serial.print(T,2);
      Serial.println(" deg C");

      // Start a pressure measurement:
      // The parameter is the oversampling setting, from 0 to 3 (highest res, longest wait).
      // If request is successful, the number of ms to wait is returned.
      // If request is unsuccessful, 0 is returned.

      status = pressure.startPressure(3);
      if (status != 0)

        delay(status);

        // Retrieve the completed pressure measurement:
        // Note that the measurement is stored in the variable P.
        // Note also that the function requires the previous temperature measurement (T).
        // (If temperature is stable, you can do one temperature measurement for a number of pressure measurements.)
        // Function returns 1 if successful, 0 if failure.

        status = pressure.getPressure(P,T);
        if (status != 0)

          // The pressure sensor returns abolute pressure, which varies with altitude.
          // To remove the effects of altitude, use the sealevel function and your current altitude.
          // This number is commonly used in weather reports.
          // Parameters: P = absolute pressure in mb, ALTITUDE = current altitude in m.
          // Result: p0 = sea-level compensated pressure in mb

          p0 = pressure.sealevel(P,ALTITUDE); // we're at 1655 meters (Boulder, CO)

    else Serial.println("error retrieving temperature measurement\n");
  }
  else Serial.println("error starting temperature measurement\n");

  delay(5000);  // Pause for 5 seconds.
}
{% endhighlight %}

When cabled and powered on use Putty to monitor the serial port and the output should be similar to the below:

>provided altitude: 31.00 meters    
temperature: 29.22 deg C    
absolute pressure: 1012.68 hPa    
relative (sea-level) pressure: 1016.41 hPa

The final set-up

All In One
===

I was going to individually connect all the modules to the Arduino and execute their code one at a time but I got bored of that and decided to connect everything together as it will be in it's final state.

Here's the setup
![Final Wiring]({{ site.url }}/media/images/201511_enviot/TiTe2_bb.png)

And here's what it looks like in real life
![Real Life]({{ site.url }}/media/images/201511_enviot/TiTe2_bb.png)

I've since run the example code from the Arduino Adafruit library and confirmed I can connect to the wireless using the C3300 wireless module. One mistake I made when trying to connect was not having 802.11b/g enabled on my router. This meant I had no obvious errors display on the serial monitor of the Arduino so it took me a while to realise why it wasn't connecting. After enabling 802.11b/g it connected and I was able to run the sketches. My favourite was the mini web server displaying *Hello World!* in my web browser served from the Arduino.

Since I know the Arduino can successfully read data from all the modules in its current connected state I will move onto designing the software. Arduino Uno has limited resources so be looking at designing the software to send from the Arduino to a central location that has enough capacity to display the data over the Internet. This means the it will only need to maintain one connection to the cloud service and the cloud service to many devices.

The first cloud service I found was [Freeboard.io](https://www.freeboard.io) so I'll be going with that for my dashboard. I had planned on creating my own web enabled dashboard but it's probably better I take baby steps and perhaps learn from the model of Freeboard.


Final Update
===
I won't be updating this particular post anymore. After loading up all of the libraries and defining most of my global variables I found I only had 108 bytes for local variables. This is a problem since I've not even written most of the program.

Instead I'll be starting a new post with the alternative plan of attack.
